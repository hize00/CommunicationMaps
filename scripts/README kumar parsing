HOW TO WRITE .dat FILE:

A .dat file is composed by 4 sections, each one terminating with ';'
The syntax of the .dat file is really important for the parsing function called inside the algorithm.
VERTEXES = number of vertexes of the completely connected graph
VELOCITY = velocity of the robots
POINTS_TO_EXPLORE = pairs of points that need to be explored
DISTANCE_MATRIX = full matrix with the distance. Indexes go from 0 to VERTEXES-1. The time_matrix is derived from this one (DISTANCE/VELOCITY).

See file "5nodes.dat" for a good example.


HOW TO RUN:

1. Open the terminal and go to the directory where the file is
2. TYPE: python filename.py filedat.dat obj_fun

obj_fun: distance OR time
